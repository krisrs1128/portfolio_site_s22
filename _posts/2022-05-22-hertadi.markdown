Description: This app visualizes the like-to-view ratio of Super Bowl
commercials that aired from 2000- 2020 from the top ten advertising companies on
Youtube. The visualizations are done by a time series graph showing overall
trends of the like-to-view ratio, and also by the category of advertisements
versus their resulting like-to-view ratios. The app allows a pinpoint of data
points by filtering based on year aired as well as the advertising companies.
