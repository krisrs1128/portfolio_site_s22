Description: This portfolio project aims to show the population situations as well as the working situations in
Finland in order to provide a general picture of how urbanization relates to the population
migration to the big cities. It contains three interactive graphs: one showing the geometric
distribution of offices in Finland, one displaying the population growth over time in each city,
and one showing the growth countrywide. We can conclude from the graph that the population in
Finland has grown over the year, especially in big cities, where most of the people work and live. <a href="https://data-viz.it.wisc.edu/content/4fb174b7-0dfa-4dfd-862b-a7c064e73982">Click here to visit the interactive app.</a>
