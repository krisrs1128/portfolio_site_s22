This visualization shows the abortion and pregnancy rates from 1988 to 2016 in
the United States. It shows abortion and pregnancy rates first through the years
as a heatmap to show individual years. Then the bottom plot is a bivariate
choropleth map showing the rates as an aggregate over the years in proportion to
the two rates per state.
