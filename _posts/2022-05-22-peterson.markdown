<b>Author: Samuel Peterson</b>

Description: After failing to land a data-oriented internship, I found myself
working as an intern in a  compensation department within Human Resources at a
firm. Although I was originally  demoralized that I could not land a
data-oriented role, I quickly found opportunities to  implement my data science
skill set on a wide range of HR data related to performance,  compensation,
attrition, tenure, and more. This mock HR data set from Kaggle allowed me to
expand upon my visualization skills of HR data.
