This application allows users to compare seasonal trends in major social media
stocks from 2012 to 2022. Users can select two social media companies whose
stocks they’re interested in exploring and a variable that will be mapped on the
y-axis. Users can also filter years they’re interested in based on which the
line graph of yearly trend and the boxplot of monthly trends will be drawn.
