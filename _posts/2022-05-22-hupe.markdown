This portfolio project aims to visualize information about European Ski Resort Passes, via an interactive app. The app allows the user to select a European country of interest, which renders diagrams with ski resort information relevant to that country. The information depicted includes mean ski pass price across countries, night skiing availability, slope difficulty, and ski pass prices for the resorts in the selected country.
