Description: Anyone interested in betting on football games generally
understands the game, the teams, and the odds at hand. However, sometimes
personal knowledge isnâ€™t enough, especially when money is at risk. This
application is designed to help bettors make smarter decisions regarding the
spread and over/under lines for games. Combining betting data since 2000, the
application offers several plots to help users search for trends regarding the
favored team, as well as a table to search for opponents and compare the teams
and the result of those games. While some may say that no bet is a smart bet,
there is a lot of enjoyment to be found in betting on NFL games. With the help
of this application, bettors can make sound decisions and be more confident in
the money they are investing.
