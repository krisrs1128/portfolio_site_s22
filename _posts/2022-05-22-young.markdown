<b>Author: David Young</b>
Description: My goal with this app was to determine how much user and critic
scores differed and look at which publishers/ developers create high quality
games from a users’ (gamers’) perspective. I was also interested in which
developers worked with any given publisher and how many copies of their game
they were able to sell and quantify how successful an individual game was.
