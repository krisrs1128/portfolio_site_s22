This application aims to visualize yearly beer production, both in cans and bottles, across 48 US
states (DC, HI, AL removed) from 2008-2019. Users can select any year of interest, from 2008-
2019, to see both the top-15 beer-producing states, as well as the beer production of all
continental US states on a US map.
