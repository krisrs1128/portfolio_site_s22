This Web App aims to use previous patientsâ€™ experiences to assess the factors
that  affect heart disease to help hospitals assess the severity of heart
disease in patients  easily at an early stage. By looking at the combination of
heart disease related factors,  the shiny app allows users to see how many
people in the database with the same  traits have or do not have heart disease.
The shiny app mainly consists of three parts:  the selections, the bar plot of
the number of people who do or do not have heart  disease under the selected
factors, and the data table of corresponding patients.
