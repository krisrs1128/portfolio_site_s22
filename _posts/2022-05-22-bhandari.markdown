Description: This visualization presents the top 200 most popular artists, based
on Billboard’s top 100, in a scatter plot of spotify popularity and the most
number of weeks spent in Billboard’s top 100. The first scatter plot gives
insight into the artists’ energy (fast/loud tracks score higher energy value)
and danceability (0 being least danceable/groovy) in their overall music. The
second scatter plot presents information about the artists’ valence (low valence
being sad or negative) and speechiness (.3 being more rap and low value being
close to instrumental music) in their overall music. <a href="https://data-viz.it.wisc.edu/connect/#/apps/d9e1bb3d-57fa-41ea-b3e0-a60391f879d9">Read the portfolio by clicking here.</a>
