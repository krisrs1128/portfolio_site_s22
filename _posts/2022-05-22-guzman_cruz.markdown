Description: This interactive scatter plot lets you explore different types of chocolates through their chocolate review (their rating) and their cocoa percentage. You can choose what bean-origin country you want to explore, the number of ingredients the chocolate has, and the year the review was made. You can also see the description of the chocolate by clicking on a data-dot, and you can also see the table on the bottom to clearly look at the data!
