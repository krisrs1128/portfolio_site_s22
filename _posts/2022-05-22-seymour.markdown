Description: The data I found contains a record of people who have died or gone
missing during the process of migration to an international destination. This
dataset is a very important resource to use when trying to find missing people
or finding patterns in migration incidents. These missing people may never be
found without the records documenting when and how they went missing. This is a
global dataset that includes information about where people are migrating to,
how they died or went missing, and many more details about their disappearance.
