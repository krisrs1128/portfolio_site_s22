This personal portfolio presents a visualization of the Data on shots taken
during the 2014-2015 season. The main graphs are the shot clock and field goal
Results showing the remaining shot clock and the shot attempts in every second
remaining with the color differentiating the made and miss outcome. The second
graph shows the shot distance and the defenderâ€™s distance having the decision on
differentiating the shot by their points type or shot result. The remaining
graphs show the shot distance density and the count of shots by points type for
your information.
