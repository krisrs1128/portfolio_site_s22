Description: This project examines the relationship between election results and the impact of
Covid-19. In particular, it examines how many people in each state became infected or died due
to Covid-19, and compared that to the stateâ€™s outcome in the 2020 election. It features an
interactive graph to watch the Covid-19 disease spread over the country over a two year period.
