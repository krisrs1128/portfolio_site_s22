The  datasets  I  selected  for  this  portfolio  are  the  geographic  location
and  the  population  of California cities, and I hope to help people who want
to settle in California in the future find suitable cities according to their
different preferences for factors such as geographic location, year  of
incorporation,  and  population.  Regarding  the  visualization,  I  applied
the  linked brushing to create two scatterplots of geographic location and
regression and one point plot, and  thereâ€™s  also  a  static  bar  plot.  The
plots  show  that  there  is  a  slight  negative  correlation between the year
of incorporation and population.
