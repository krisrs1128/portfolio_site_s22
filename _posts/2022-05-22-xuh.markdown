This project explores how U.S. academic institutions contribute to the
open-source community by visualizing their efforts and interests on GitHub. The
broad open-source collaboration landscape across institutions is also explored
as an inter-connected “social network”. The visualization and analysis of these
projects are based on the data from Google’s public data warehouse
“github-repos”, which provides weekly updated data fresh from GitHub.
