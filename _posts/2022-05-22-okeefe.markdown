The goal of this visualization was to view trends in my Spotify
data over the period I was able to download from their site â€“ Mar 10, 2021
through Mar 10, 2022. The initial view shows two graphs one displaying the
listening time per day (with tooltips for the date, top artist, songs played,
and listening time) while the second shows the number of unique artists for each
day. When a data point is clicked on either graph the selected day is displayed
at the top, the top graph switches to hourly listening times, the bottom graph
switches to the top artists of the day, and a data table is displayed with all
of the data for the day.
