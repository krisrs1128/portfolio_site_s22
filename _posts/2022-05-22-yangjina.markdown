Description: (Figure 1) The type of attacks that led to deaths in each country are aligned
by the number (or percent) of deaths on the y-axis. Select a specific two years
and compare them. It is possible to know which type of attack caused the death toll in the year.
(Figure 2) On the world map, the location of the terrorist attack are marked in
different colors depending on the type of attack. The area that has been
attacked a lot has a darker cluster color, and if you click the cluster, the map
will be zoomed in. Click a specific point in the enlarged area to pop up
additional information.
